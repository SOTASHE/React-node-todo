This webapp is also using [ JSONPlaceholder]([https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos],) as instructed but I also build my own custom routes and controllers with nodes and express.
# get
- http://localhost:5000/todos
# post
- http://localhost:5000/todos

# delete
- http://localhost:5000/todos/${id}



> Aproach
  * Build custom routes and controllers with node and express
  * build a fully responsive website.
  * use [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).
  * query data from a third party library using ` useEffect hook` with the `async` and `await` promise.
  * use  states around the application without any redux, just hooks.
  * Connect server and client

## Installation

Download the repo with:

```bash
$ https://github.com/SOTASHE/React-node-todo
```

After downloading the repo you can cd into the `Server` and then open up your console and type 

```bash
$ npm install
```

before  running the client first make sure server is running, run the following script to run server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

now you can run the following to start the client:
```bash
$ cd client
$ npm start
```
incase you having problems with local routings from my server you can use the one from json place holder:
#delete 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${id}

#get 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

#post
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos


All the assets are already included so you can run the application and it will work. 


Happy Coding!
